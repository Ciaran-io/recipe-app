# Create Recipe App

![Solo Chef](./static/images/app-screenshot.png)

This web application was built as part of my projects for Code Institute full-stack web development. The application is built using Python, MongoDB, Vanilla Javascript and Tailwind CSS a popular CSS framework. The application is intended for users who would like to create & store their recipes and make changes to their recipes.

### Technologies

- Languages: Python, Javascript, HTML & CSS
- Frameworks: Flask, TailwindCSS
- Database: MongoDB
- API's : EmailJS, Google Fonts

### Frameworks

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
 > Flask is a Python micro framework that was used to serve static content, & interacts with the MongoDB database.

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 > Tailwindcss s a utility first CSS framework.

### Database

 > EmailJs is used as a way for the user to subscribe to the site and receive new recipes. Once the user inputs their email they will receive an automated email informing them of their registration

<br> 
### Tools

- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): IDE used for code editing.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac): Used for version control.
- [Github](https://github.com): Used to store & view the project outside local envoirnmemt.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): Used for wireframes & design for the project.

# Testing
### Automated Testing

> The following testing tools were used to check for possible errors and warnings..
- [Python validator:](http://pep8online.com/checkresult) Used to validate Python
- [W3C HTML Markup Validation:](https://validator.w3.org/ 'Link to w3C HTML markup validations') used to validate HTML. Result displayed no errors or & 5 warnings.
- [W3C CSS Markup Validation:](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ 'Link to w3C CSS markup validations') used to validate CSS. The result displayed 12 errors. The errors are the due to how tailwind converts the HTML to CSS and are unavoidable errors using tailwinds classes.
- [Jshint Javascript Markup Validation:](https://jshint.com/ 'Link to Jshint Javascript markup validations') used to validate Javascript. The result displayed 4 warnings in the main.js file.
&nbsp;
 Javascript Issues: Four warnings on line 81, 91, 97 & 146 "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics."

 <br>

### Manual Testing

> Accordion on the recipe page

- Clicked on the dropdown icon to verify recipe information displayed correctly.
<br>


> User recipes page

- Users recipe - checked option to delete would remove a recipe from MongoDB database and users recipes.

- Checked option to edit users recipe would redirect to edit recipe page and provide the user with a form to edit the recipe or option to cancel changes.
<br>

> Page Links

- Verified each link on the mobile and desktop menu links follow to the correct page.
 <br>

> Email subscribe form validation

- Checked user input is required.
- The button text will change when the submission is sent.
- The user will receive a subscription verification email through email js.
 <br>

> Developer Tools Testing

- Tested mobile and desktop site using lighthouse tools in Google Chrome.
 Note: See results at end of testing documentation. The result is shown in png images.
 <br>

### Issued to resolve:

- Remove render-blocking CSS.
- Defer offscreen images.
 <br>

> Tested Browsers

- Note: on desktop developer tools were used to check for errors in the console & view how the application would view across multiple viewing sizes using the responsive mode in the toggle device toolbar option.
 <br>

> Desktop tested browser applications

- Safari
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
 <br>

> Mobile tested browser applications

- Safari
 No issues detected in functionality across multiple browsers and devices behaved as expected.


> Google Chrome Lighthouse testing results.
